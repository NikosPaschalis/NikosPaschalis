## An enthusiast Full Stack Developer from Greece 🇬🇷 ##
Hello my name is Nikos Paschalis, I have a BSc in Computer Science and I'm currently working as a Technical Associate at 6th Health Region of Peloponnese. I'm passionate about web development and I'm spending most of my time improving my skills from front to back end. Currently learning ReactJS and building my portfolio page to hone my skills.
